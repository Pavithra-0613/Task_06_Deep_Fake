(Scene: A Syracuse student is strolling around New York City in the summer and unexpectedly bumps into the Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse coach. They decide to do a quick street-style Q&A.)

Student: Coach! What a surprise running into you here in New York. Mind if I ask you a couple of quick questions about last season?
Coach: Of course, fire away.

Student: First off, who was your go-to scorer this season?
Coach: That would be Megan Carney. She had an incredible year and was the player we relied on when we needed goals.

Student: And who was the best at setting up those plays?
Coach: Emma Ward. She has amazing vision and was constantly finding her teammates in scoring positions.

Student: Every team needs someone to do the gritty work — who was that player for you?
Coach: Olivia Adamson. She hustled nonstop, winning draws and scooping up loose balls to keep us in control.

Student: Looking ahead, what’s the one focus for next season?
Coach: We want to tighten up our defense. Katie Goodale is a key part of that — she shuts opponents down and makes those clutch defensive plays that change games.

Student: Thanks, Coach. I’ll let you get back to enjoying the city. Good luck next season!
